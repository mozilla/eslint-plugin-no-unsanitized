# Disallow unsanitized code (no-unsanitized)

These rules disallow unsafe coding practices that may result into security
vulnerabilities. We will disallow assignments (e.g., to innerHTML) as well as
calls (e.g., to insertAdjacentHTML) without the use of a pre-defined escaping
function. The escaping functions must be called with a template string.
The function names are hardcoded as `Sanitizer.escapeHTML` and `escapeHTML`.
The plugin also supports the
[Sanitizer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Sanitizer_API)
and calls to `.setHTML()` are also allowed by default.

This plugin is built for and used within Mozilla to maintain and improve the security
of our products and services.

# Rule Details

## method
The *method* rule disallows certain function calls.
E.g., `document.write()` or `insertAdjacentHTML()`.
See [docs/rules/method.md](docs/rules/method.md) for more.

## property
The *property* rule disallows certain assignment expressions, e.g., to `innerHTML`.

See [docs/rules/property.md](docs/rules/property.md) for more.


## Examples

Here are a few examples of code that we do not want to allow:

```js
foo.innerHTML = input.value;
bar.innerHTML = "<a href='"+url+"'>About</a>";
```

A few examples of allowed practices:

```js
foo.innerHTML = 5;
bar.innerHTML = "<a href='/about.html'>About</a>";
bar.innerHTML = escapeHTML`<a href='${url}'>About</a>`;
```
