# Instructions for creating a new release

# Check everything locally:

-   `npm run test`
-   `npm run lint`

# Preparing the code

-   Bump version in package.json
-   git add
-   git commit
-   git push to branch
-   Get code review (branch protection) and then merge
-   wait for travis results just to be sure.

**At this point people tracking `main` should already get the new version**

# Publish the release as a new version

-   git tag -a x.y.z
-   npm publish
-   git push --tags
-   Go to [https://github.com/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/releases](https://github.com/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/releases) to create a new release. Pick the right tag.
